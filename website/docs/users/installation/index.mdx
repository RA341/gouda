# Installation

Gouda consists of two components: the server and the client.



## Server

A server instance is required for clients to connect and function.

There are two distinct variants for each OS:

##### Desktop Edition

The Desktop Edition is designed for personal computer usage and includes:

- Native UI implementation
- Web-based user interface
- System tray integration
- Full functionality optimized for desktop environments

##### Server Edition

The Server Edition is designed for headless environments such as seedboxes and servers:

- Lightweight binary without desktop dependencies
- Web-based user interface only
- No system tray implementation
- Designed for remote access and management


### Installation Options

- Include web UI only for browser-based access
- Recommended when Gouda is deployed on a remote server

**Desktop Variants:**
