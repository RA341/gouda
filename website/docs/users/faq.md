# FAQ

### Q. Will this mess with my ratio or remove the download from my download client?

No. Gouda only checks the download status from your torrent client, it will NEVER modify, delete or otherwise touch the file at the download location.

If gouda is unable to hardlink the downloaded file it will only display an error, and no further action will be taken by gouda.

### Q. Does this work with freeleech and personal freeleech torrents?

Yes, As long as you buy the torrent as freeleech (or if it is already set as freeleech) before sending it to gouda, 
it will behave as if you started the download yourself and will not affect your ratio.

### Q. Is it secure or against myanonamouse TOS?

I have been using it for a while now, and it has not caused any problems on the site for me. 
This tool mimics what someone would do normally on the site since you actually need to be onsite to use it anyway.

The extension and the app are fully local and open source. You can check the code for yourself, or ask ChatGPT ;)
